# Towards interactivity

R has made big improvements on their graphics capabilities with [`lattice`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=lattice) and [`ggplot2`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=ggplot2)

However, these are _static_ graphics and could be improved with interactive capabilities. 

With **shiny**, it's actually possible to layer interaction on top of static R plots! Let's consider a small example.

---

# Example Data

We have data on some compounds measured under different conditions:

 * **type**: screening (via single point conc) vs confirmation (via IC50 dose-response)
 * **target** format: the drug target

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(readr)
assays <- read_csv("IC50_data.csv")
str(assays)
```

We will plot the screening result versus the confirmation IC50 for both formats. If we only have the screening results, how have those related to the more definitive IC50?


---

# Screening results

.pull-left[
```r
p <- ggplot(
  data = assays, 
    aes(
      x = Single_Point, 
      y = Dose_Response, 
      color = Target
    )
  ) +
  geom_point(size = 4, alpha = .4) +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +  
  scale_y_log10()
p
```

What about that point with a low `Dose_Response`? What compound is it?
]


.pull-right[
```{r, echo = FALSE}
p <- ggplot(data = assays, aes(x = Single_Point, y = Dose_Response, color = Target)) +
  geom_point(size = 4, alpha = .4) +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +  
  scale_y_log10()
p
```
]

# Graphical queries in shiny

We can leverage **shiny**'s "static interactivity" to get at the data behind a hovered (or clicked or brushed) point(s).

```r
library(shiny)

ui <- fluidPage(
  # Exposes hover info on the server as `input$hover`
  # Can also do this with click or brush
  plotOutput("plot", hoverId = "hover"),
  tableOutput("table")
)

server <- function(input, output, session) {
  output$plot <- renderPlot(p)
  output$table <- renderTable(nearPoints(assays, input$hover))
}

shinyApp(ui, server)
```

# Getting more interactive

**shiny**'s static plot interaction is great for getting user input from one view and sending it to another (e.g. displaying a table of selected point(s)).

Sometimes it pays off if the graphic itself is web-based and interactive. Many R packages can produce these via the **htmlwidgets** package, which provides a consistent interface across different contexts (e.g., R console, RStudio, shiny, rmarkdown, etc)
  * To see a gallery of the most popular htmlwidgets (we'll cover some of these) -- https://gallery.htmlwidgets.org/
  * To learn more about htmlwidgets itself -- http://www.htmlwidgets.org/
    
Today we'll introduce two interactive graphing libraries: **ggiraph** and **plotly**. 
  * If you know **ggplot2**, you can easily use these packages to make your static graphs interactive.
  * Due to their different approaches, **ggiraph** does a better job of maintaining the look and feel of the **ggplot2** graph, but **plotly** provides a more fully-featured and extensible framework (you can also use it without **ggplot2**).

# `plotly`

It's easiest to get started with **plotly**'s `ggplotly()`. This function converts a static **ggplot2** to an interactive web-based graphic.

.pull-left[

```r
library(plotly)
p <- ggplot(data = assays, aes(x = Single_Point, y = Dose_Response, color = Target)) +
  geom_point(size = 4, alpha = .4) +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +  
  scale_y_log10()
ggplotly(p)
```

# `plotly`

It's easiest to get started with **plotly**'s `ggplotly()`. This function converts a static **ggplot2** to an interactive web-based graphic.

.pull-left[

```r
library(plotly)
p <- ggplot(data = assays, aes(x = Single_Point, y = Dose_Response, color = Target)) +
  geom_point(aes(text = Compound), size = 4, alpha = .4) +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +  
  scale_y_log10()
# show only the text aes (instead of all of them) in the tooltip
ggplotly(p, tooltip = "text")
```

To control the tooltip that appears, use the `text` aesthetic (notice how `Compound` is now shown on hover).

# `plotly`

You can also make **plotly** graphs without **ggplot2**, which is useful for stuff like [3D charts](https://plotly-r.com/d-charts.html), [maps](https://plotly-r.com/maps.html), and generally having more control. Read more at <https://plotly-r.com> 

.pull-left[

```{r, eval = FALSE}
plot_ly(
  assays, x = ~Single_Point, y = ~Dose_Response, 
  color = ~Target, text = ~Compound,
  size = I(50), alpha = 0.4
) %>% layout(yaxis = list(type = "log"))
```

**plotly** also provides the building block for other useful packages like [**heatmaply**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/heatmaply/vignettes/heatmaply.html) and [**TSStudio**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/TSstudio/index.html)

# Access plotly events in shiny

```r
library(shiny)

ui <- fluidPage(
  plotlyOutput("plot"),
  tableOutput("table")
)

server <- function(input, output, session) {
  output$plot <- renderPlotly({
    p <- ggplot(assays, aes(x = Single_Point, y = Dose_Response, color = Target)) +
      geom_point(aes(text = Compound, customdata = Compound), size = 4, alpha = .4) +
      geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +  
      scale_y_log10()
    ggplotly(p, tooltip = "text")
  })
  # event_data() function can be used to access information about all sorts of events
  output$table <- renderTable({
    hovered_compound <- event_data("plotly_hover")$customdata
    filter(assays, Compound %in% hovered_compound)
  })
  
}

shinyApp(ui, server)
```

# Exercise

Run the following example apps

```r
plotly_example("shiny", "event_data")
plotly_example("shiny", "event_data_3D")
```

1. How many different plotly events are these apps showing? Can you trigger all of them?

2. Modify the shiny app in the last slide to respond to click events instead of hover. Modify it again to respond to brush events.

# ggiraph

**plotly**'s `ggplotly()` doesn't always get the conversion right. **ggiraph** does a better at preserving the look, but doesn't have quite as many interactive features as **plotly**.

.pull-left[
```{r ggiraph_example, eval=FALSE}
library(ggiraph)
## We could add a column for click behavior:
# assays$click <- {a vector of urls}
ggiraph_ggplot <- 
  ggplot(assays, aes(x = Single_Point, y = Dose_Response, color = Target)) +
  geom_point_interactive(
    # could also add `onclick = click`
    aes(tooltip = Compound), 
    size = 4, 
    alpha = .4
  ) +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +  
  scale_y_log10()

## show using
ggiraph(ggobj = ggiraph_ggplot, width = 1)
```

Note the use of `geom_point_interactive()` instead of `geom_point()`.

.pull-right[
```{r ggiraph_show, echo = FALSE}
library(ggiraph)
## We could add a column for click behavior:
# assays$click <- {a vector of urls}

ggiraph_ggplot <- 
  ggplot(assays, aes(x = Single_Point, y = Dose_Response, color = Target)) +
